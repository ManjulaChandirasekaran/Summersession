# Executive Summary
By the end of this lab, you'll have comfortable understanding on the hardware, and its function with an a computer. 

# Hardware
## Hard Drives and Memory
* We will dive into the difference between latency and transfer rates on the performance of a hard drive. As, for the difference in the two hard drive peformance section, we will look into latency first as it looking to where the data should accessed and saved. Latency runs on the read/write computer structure. It's calculated on the spindle speed, and the time it half rotates. While transfer rates reffers to the speed rate that data is transferred, or how fast can the hard drive transfer information the PC memory.    
* Then we move on to the solid state (SSD) hard drive. The SSD was the first leap to how we now take the the computer out of our homes, it is different from a traditional hard drive, it doesn't run on spinning memory structure. Instead, SSD works off of flash memory, flash memory is more expensive than hard disk but way faster. FLash memory can be consider more durable and reliable than a hard disk.
* RAM, RAM, and more RAM is always a great thing to have when making a computer run faster. There are many types of RAM, but to keep it simple RAM is a memory trasnfer rate, it decides on how fast it can transfer memory to different components throughout the computer, this makes the computer more efficient.
* Finally, we look at the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths. First, we look at the 32 bit data processor, it was introduced in 1990s and early 2000s on most computers. The 32 bit data processer had its time. Handling up 4 GBs of data, if you want to be technical 3.5 GBs, 32 bit was a stepping stone for today's processor. The 64 bit data processor is crushing the system og the past. As, the 64 bit can handel 18 quintillion bytes of RAM, it's just blowing 32 bit data path in the water.   

## ALU and Control Unit
* The interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU is the like a human heart. Instead of pumping blood, its bumping billions of numbers in and out. The ALU is perfoming all the arithmetic and logical operations, and the control unit is decoding the information and feeding it to the CPU.

## CPU, Input and Output
* CPU:
  * Is the brain of the computer, its moving components every millisecond, telling the computer what it needs and doesn't need to function 
* Input:
  * you have your classic USB, HDMI, and charging ports 
* Output:
  * screen monitor or a nasty terminal error message

## Logic Gates and circuits
* The truth about the truth table is it's a is a breakdown of a logic function by listing all possible values the function can attain and with my knowledge on a NAND gate truth table there are run endless on high and low possiblities that could come.
* The NAND gate truth table goes off the system high and low or 0 and 1 compared to the an AND gate system goes off of boolean system a true or flase information process. 

## IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
* The purpose of IEEE is to publish and consolidate ideas dealing with electrotechnology. IEEE was founded in 1963 by engineers, professors, and students with the purpose knowledge sharing to people to make humans life easier. With billions of people sharing information throught the day, it's important to keep ethics in the front device design. Mistakes are apart of life but it's how learn from those mistakes. In the world of technology, it's best practice to have a guideline system, so you don't make the same mistakes more than twice.

# Data Representation
## Numeric Conversions
* decimal:
  * human friendly, easy counting scheme for humans to run through
* Binary:
  * Base-two, is used by computers to count by two numbers, 0 and 1 are those numbers.
* Hexadecimal numbers:
  * Base-sixteen, uses sixteen digit space, means that sixteen different digits can appear on one line. 
* Convert the decimal number 211 to binary showing your work (be sure to include your name in your screenshot or scanned file) and save to a file named DecimalConversion and upload to your lab folder. 

## Hexadecimal color representation
* Convert the binary representation: 10110101 to decimal and save your work to a file named BinaryConversion and upload to the lab folder. 
* Explain the representation: #ab00ff using the site: https://www.colorhexa.com/ 
* The color if on a web sites would be problematic. The reason why it's too bright, if you would put black text on the color it would bled into the background. If wanted to get fancy, i'll would rollout a red background with black text something more appealing to the eys. 

# Conclusion
* This lab has taught me that the hardware is the muscle of the computer. The computer has become more and more user friendly, and it's thanks to the hardware growing over the years. The hardware of the computer has given people more confindence to use their devices for endless possibilities, people everywhere are connected just by their mobile device. The fact that the hardwares memory and other dependecies have grown to handle such request.
